# How to install scripts:
> 1. Download the latest version of the script you want to use, as an example: Rampage (in our Discord server, go to `#Ã¸zark-scripts`/`#scripts-and-things > pinned messages`)
> 2. Place the `.asi` file into `Documents/Ozark/Red Dead Redemption 2/ScriptHook`/`Documents/Ozark/Grand Theft Auto 5/ScriptHook`. (If the script comes with it's own folder, example: "RampageFiles", place the folder in your Red Dead Redemption/Grand Theft Auto V game directory (where the RDR2.exe/GTAV.exe is located).
